####Notes

* Maybe add documentation for the `<spawns safe="true">` attribute?
* `TODO:` watch a match of Parallax to see how exactly lanes function so I can write a better description.
* Perhaps follow the [wikipedia writing guide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writing_better_articles) & rewrite the sections that use you or your?

**Undocumented Commits & Stuff:**

* `af0349` Allow velocity to be set when entering regions.
* Added the ability to specify what dimension a world can be loaded in.
* Score `<limit>` and `<death>` subelement. ???  
`<death>` element specifies the score amount added/subtracted for kills/deaths.
`<limit>` limits the score, when a team (player?) reaches this score the game ends.

* Added the health and hunger kits.

      <!--  Min and max values? -->
      <health>20</health>
      <saturation>20</saturation>
      <foodlevel>20</foodlevel>

* Added the hunger module.  
`<hunger>` Does it have a `depletion` subelement?

* Filter `<void>` `<not>` `<one>` `<all>` and `<any>` elements.


Possibly Documented:

* Added the time limit module.
* `3723a38` Implement a customizable cooldown for scoreboxes (default 1 second).
